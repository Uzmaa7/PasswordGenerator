## 📖 What I Learned

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of **React Hooks** such as **`useState`**, **`useEffect`**, **`useCallback`**, and **`useRef`**.  
I learned how to effectively manage **component state**, handle **user inputs** like **checkboxes** and **range sliders**, and generate **dynamic data** based on changing **dependencies**.

I also gained hands-on experience in identifying and fixing **common React bugs**, especially those related to **state updates**, **event handling**, and **logic errors**.  
Overall, this project significantly improved my confidence in building **interactive UI components** using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.
