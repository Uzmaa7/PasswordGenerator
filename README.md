# React + Vite

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of React Hooks such as useState, useEffect, useCallback, and useRef.
I learned how to effectively manage component state, handle user inputs like checkboxes and range sliders, and generate dynamic data based on changing dependencies.

I also gained hands-on experience in identifying and fixing common React bugs, especially those related to state updates, event handling, and logic errors.
Overall, this project significantly improved my confidence in building interactive UI components using React and Tailwind CSS.
